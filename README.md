<h2>Simulation:</h2>

To evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, six mathematical models are considered in the development of this study. 
  
<h2>Datasets:</h2>

 We apply the methods analyzed in the study to two real datasets for outlier detection of functional curves.
 
 <h3>El Ni√±o Sea Surface Temperature data</h3>

The dataset to be used is obtained from the <em>rainbow\_1.4.zip</em> library, available at https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rainbow/.

  <h3>SCImago Journal Rank data</h3>

A second example, we utilized data from the SCImago Journal Rank website, available at https://www.scimagojr.com.
